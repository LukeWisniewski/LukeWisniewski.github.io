  <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
  <p>My name is Luke Wisniewski, and I am a Dartmouth '26 majoring in Economics and Mathematics. I am very passionate about taking quantiative information and applying it to interesting social questions. While my recent economic research has largely pertained to sports economics (a great passion and hobby of mine), I am also interested in addressing more pressing social concerns such as education and the climate. My work in mathematics has involved numerical simulations of delay differential equation systems, with a particular focus on applications towards climate modeling.</p>
