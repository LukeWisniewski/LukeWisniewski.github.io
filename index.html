  <h1>Welcome to My Page!</h1>
  <p>My name is Luke Wisniewski, and I am a Dartmouth '26 majoring in Economics and Mathematics. I am driven by taking quantiative information and applying it to interesting social questions. While much of my economic research has pertained to <a href="Econ_80_Final_Paper-2.pdf">sports economics</a> (a great passion and hobby of mine), I am also interested in addressing more pressing social concerns such as <a href="Econ_67_Final_Draft-5.pdf">education</a> and the climate. My work in mathematics has involved numerical simulations of delay differential equation systems, with a particular focus on applications towards climate modeling.</p>
